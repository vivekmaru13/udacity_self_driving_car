### Project 1- Finding LaneLines
The Goal of this project is to find Lane markings on the road by capturing the frames from the wind-shield camera. 

This project is completed using Computer Vision techniques. This project also contains a pipeline like implementation to find lane line from continuous video feed. 
Before running the pipeline like implementation directly on the video, we have used provided test images to fine tune the implementation and make sure that it works on given images well.

Follow through the Jupyter Notebook and the code should be self explanatory.  

Please find example output image below.
