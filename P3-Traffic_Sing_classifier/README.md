[notebook]: ./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb "Notebook"

The goal of this project was to build a CNN in TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset.](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

There are some intermediate steps carried before we got to the training of the model. Steps are as below. 
* Dataset: Load the dataset and explore/summarize it by visualizing the dataset to see the distribution of the classes.
* CNN: Design and train a CNN classifier
* Test: Test the model on 5 new images which was never used in training/validation/testing.
* Conclusion: Check the softmax values/output from the model and study the confidence the model has on the test images.

Implementation and visualization can be found in the [notebook][notebook]. The notebook is also the final submission for the project.
